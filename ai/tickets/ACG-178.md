# ACG-178 - Add logging to createMpqTreeV3 API

**Ticket Summary**: Enhanced debugging capabilities by adding comprehensive logging to workflow creation API
**Date**: 2025-09-11
**Type**: enhancement
**Complexity**: 2/5 (Low-Medium)

## Requirements

Add logging to createMpqTreeV3 API to improve debugging capabilities and operational visibility into the workflow creation process.

## Implementation Summary

**What Was Implemented**: Added 7 strategic DEBUG-level log statements to the createMpqTreeV3 service method to track execution flow and key parameters

1. **Service Area**: workflow
2. **Patterns Used**: service, logging
3. **Files & APIs**:
```
    APIs:
    ├── POST /api/v3/workflow - createMpqTreeV3 endpoint for workflow creation
    │   ├── app/Http/Controllers/workflow/WorkflowController.php - existing controller with logging
    │   ├── app/Http/Services/workflow/WorkflowServiceV2.php - enhanced service logging
    │   └── ai/tickets/ACG-178-details.md - implementation documentation
```

4. **External Dependencies and Integrations**:
    - NONE - No external service integrations modified

5. **Architecture Pattern**:
    - Controller→Service pattern with enhanced service layer logging
    - Utilizes existing LoggingService infrastructure with workflow channel
    - DEBUG-level logging for operational visibility without performance impact

6. **Code Patterns**:
```php
LoggingService::logMessage(
    "WorkflowServiceV2 createMpqTreeV3 User ID : " . request()->attributes->get('user')->id . " [step description] - [context]",
    ['channel_name' => 'Workflow', 'log_type' => 'DEBUG', 'log_file_path' => storage_path('logs')."/workflow.log"]
);
```

7. **Database Changes**:
    - NONE - No database schema modifications

8. **Error Handling & Testing**:
    - Leveraged existing LoggingService error handling patterns
    - Unit tests: NONE - logging enhancement only
    - Integration test approach: Manual verification through API calls in development environment
    - Manual testing: Code review and syntax validation completed

9. **Pull Request**:
    - PR #2118

## Reusable Patterns & Context

1. **Implementation Patterns for Future Use**:
    - Service layer logging pattern: Use LoggingService with consistent channel naming and DEBUG level for operational visibility
    - Step-by-step workflow logging: Log major process milestones with meaningful identifiers (IDs, status, user context)
    - Conditional logging pattern: Add optional logging for feature-specific flows (OMS integration example)

2. **Performance & Future Context**:
    - Minimal performance impact - only string concatenation and log writes at DEBUG level
    - Future workflow debugging tickets can follow this same logging enhancement approach
    - LoggingService infrastructure supports consistent formatting across all workflow operations
    - Pattern establishes foundation for expanding logging coverage to other complex service methods
